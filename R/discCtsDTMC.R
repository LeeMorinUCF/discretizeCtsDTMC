#' Discretize a Continuous-valued Discrete-time Markov Chain
#'
#' \code{discretizeCtsDTMC} creates a discrete approximation to a Markov
#' process defined on a continuous state space in discrete time.
#' Once the state space is discretized, \code{discretizeCtsDTMC} provides tools
#' to estimate the transition matrices and analyze the Markov process.
#'
#' @note We'll think of a better name later.
#'
#' @seealso \code{multinom} function in \code{nnet} package for estimating the
#' transition matrices.
#' \code{DTMCPack} and \code{markovchain} for analyzing the discrete-time Markov
#' model once the continuous state space is discretized.
