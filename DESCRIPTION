Description: Package discretizeCtsDTMC creates a discrete approximation to a Markov
  process defined on a continuous state space in discrete time.
  Once the state space is discretized, discretizeCtsDTMC provides tools
  to estimate the transition matrices and analyze the Markov process.
  It is used to model a population of individuals, each following a  
  continuous-state Markov process in discrete time.
