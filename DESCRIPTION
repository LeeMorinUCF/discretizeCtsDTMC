Description: Package interCross uses the variation of successive 
  observations in the 
  cross section of a wide panel to identify the law of motion 
  for conduction an intervention analysis.
  interCross creates a discrete approximation to a Markov
  process defined on a continuous state space in discrete time.
  Once the state space is discretized, interCross provides tools
  to estimate the transition matrices and analyze the Markov process.
  It is used to model a population of individuals in a wide panel,  
  each following a continuous-state Markov process in discrete time.
